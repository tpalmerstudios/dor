#DOR - DATA ORGANIZER
Currently working on DOR - my personal Data OrganizeR
***Install***
No real installation yet, but we'll get there. It is a very small program with no need to install but you could add the executable to your path. In compilation you can edit the `libs/dorSettings.h` file to adjust to the filename. All necessary files are found in the `src/` directory. Just type in `make` from the main directory for standard compilation.
***Overview***
It should allow you to add in details about people, places, cars, and businesses. I'll be adding more soon. There is a lot to do, but if you want to help, feel free to email me at tpalmerstudios@gmail.com. I'm currently working on fixes for savePerson.cpp, but I'll be moving on to editPerson.cpp soon. I've got a new interface I'm working on, and hope to add a settings file so we dont need to recompile for setting chanfes...

A simple conglomeration of random things I've worked on.
Starting with some C and now C++. I've started with K&R. 
Now I'm using C++ by Tony Gaddis. I use tons of stackoverflow too!


I'll try to actually update regularly now. And hopefully
move on to bigger projects as I understand bigger concepts.
