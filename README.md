# DOR - DATA ORGANIZER

***Paused at the moment***
I am working on a First Person Shooter called Jeli at the moment and am spending most of my time on that. If you want to contribute to this project I would love to dive back in. Throw me an issue or feature request. I'll be happy to jump in if anyone finds this interesting or is trying to learn as I am. I will be uploading jeli to github soon (lost a file recently and had to spend 5 hours recovering it because I hadn't set up git yet. Hopefully I'll learn) It's based on ssloy/tinyraycaster, but hopefully with a few improvements and definitely different textures.

***Install***
No real installation yet, but we'll get there. It is a very small program with no need to install but you could add the executable to your path. In compilation you can edit the `libs/dorSettings.h` file to adjust to the filename. All necessary files are found in the `src/` directory. Just type in `make` from the main directory for standard compilation.

***Overview***
It should allow you to add in details about people, places, cars, and businesses. I'll be adding more soon. There is a lot to do, but if you want to help, feel free to email me at tpalmerstudios@gmail.com. I'm currently working on fixes for savePerson.cpp, but I'll be moving on to editPerson.cpp soon. I've got a new interface I'm working on, and hope to add a settings file so we dont need to recompile for setting changes...

A simple conglomeration of random things I've worked on.
Starting with some C and now C++. I've started with K&R. 
Now I'm using C++ by Tony Gaddis. I use tons of stackoverflow too!  


The best way that I've seen to learn is by following tutorials, like one on building your own text editor (kilo), and ssloy on Github has some really neat stuff that I'm working on. Once I get through a few more tutorials I plan on jumping back in and using the knowledge I am gaining to truly master this program. (From the text editor I've learned how to enter Raw mode and that is definitely needed to do this program correctly.) I will need to study some sorting algorithms (or maybe look at a "build your own database" tutorial) before I can really do this program well. If you can't tell, I am excited to be learning and I cant wait to show off some awesome programs here.

I'll try to actually update regularly now. And hopefully
move on to bigger projects as I understand bigger concepts.
