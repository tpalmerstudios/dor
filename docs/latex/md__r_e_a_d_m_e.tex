There is a lot to do, but if you want to help, feel free to email me at \href{mailto:tpalmerstudios@gmail.com}{\texttt{ tpalmerstudios@gmail.\+com}}. I\textquotesingle{}m currently working on fixes for \mbox{\hyperlink{save_person_8cpp}{save\+Person.\+cpp}}, but I\textquotesingle{}ll be moving on to \mbox{\hyperlink{edit_person_8cpp}{edit\+Person.\+cpp}} soon.

A simple conglomeration of random things I\textquotesingle{}ve worked on. Starting with some C and now C++. I\textquotesingle{}ve started with K\&R. Now I\textquotesingle{}m using C++ by Tony Gaddis. ~\newline
